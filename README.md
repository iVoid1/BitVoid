# ðŸ§  Coreon â€” Personal AI Agent Prototype

Coreon is a personal AI-driven agent prototype leveraging local Large Language Models (LLMs) designed to enable intelligent, context-aware interactions with users.

---

## Project Overview

Coreon is more than just a voice assistant; it is a versatile AI agent framework focused on understanding context, retrieving knowledge, and delivering intelligent responses. Voice interaction is considered one of many modular features rather than the core itself.
